// Coleman-Liau-Index-Readability-Test---Practice-Problem

// This is a practice problem that I worked on to practice writing in C
// The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output what (U.S.)
// grade level is needed to understand the text. 

// Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text,
// and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

// The formula is: index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
